        <h1>Mabel</h1>
        <p>A May Ball ticketing system.</p>
        <p><b>Mabel</b> is a modern ticketing system designed especially for your May Ball, June Event or Garden Party. It was built from the ground up to be easy to use whilst giving your committee the power to quickly do everything they need.</p>

        <h2>But I already have a ticketing system!</h2>
        <p>Almost every committee has their own legacy system, passed on from one year to the next long after the original author has left. Nearly all of them have bugs and quirks, making the ticket booking experience error-prone or unreliable. In some cases, ticketing system bugs may actually be dangerous, as malicious users circumvent security systems.</p>
        <p>Even if you’ve never had a problem with your ticketing system before, very few committees have the ability to update it in-house when new technologies appear. Can your ticketing system receive immediate online payments? Could it tie into electronic wristbands or a custom app for your event? Why waste your committee’s time by integrating these features when somebody else has already done it?</p>

      <h2>Using Mabel</h2>
      <p>There are three ways to use Mabel. You can obtain the source code for free from our <a href="#">GitHub repository</a> - but then you’re on your own. If your committee lacks the technical capacity to do that, we can do it for you instead.
