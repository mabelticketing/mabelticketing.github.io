TODO.txt


need a favicon
need logo to be saved as an image (after it looks decent)
responsiveness - needs more responsiveness (a bit buggy atm)

needs to look nicer, some margins are a little off

Perhaps we could have another thumb about payments (with corresponding fontawesome currency symbol). Then we can do a 3x3 grid - might look nicer

I think for the pricing on cards can do a smallcaps on top and normal text underneath e.g.

  O N E - O F F  P A Y M E N T          <-- SMALL
  Â£400.00                               <-- BIG

I'm not sure if pricing is correct. 

All text needs checking - there is a bit too much in places.

Please be ruthless and brutal with editing the site // I won't get offended

maybe a new photo for you/me because we arent looking the same direction and one is darker and we are different sizes

footer has 5px beneath that is white and i can't get rid of it :(

needs more mobile testing
