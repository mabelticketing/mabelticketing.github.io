				h2 But I already have a ticketing system!
				.row
					.col-md-6
						p Most committees have their own legacy system, passed on from year to year long after the original author has left. Nearly all of them have bugs and quirks, making the ticket booking experience error-prone or unreliable. In some cases, ticketing system bugs may actually be dangerous, as malicious users circumvent security systems.
						p The idea of Mabel is to have a ticketing system that is used by many colleges, contributed to by any interested computer-savvy students. This way, in the unlikely event that Mabel has flaws, they can be ironed out quickly and safely.
					.col-md-6
						p Even if you’ve never had a problem with your ticketing system before, very few committees have the ability to update it in-house when new technologies appear. Can your ticketing system receive immediate online payments? Could it tie into electronic wristbands or a custom app for your event? Why waste your committee’s time by integrating these features when somebody else has already done it?

							h4 #[span.h  Fair ticketing]
						p Everyone is delivered the ticketing form at the same time, so that no one is left out.[check] When tickets are sold out any new bookings will be added to a waiting list, so you can still allocate tickets on a first-come first-served basis.
